# Discord Bot UHM

This project is a Discord bot made for a community server: "Lux Nightclub". It is made to help the creator make personalized commands that no other server has. For example, instead of a basic verification with a captcha when entering the server, the creator decided to let people create a server ID Card with the captcha in it.

## How to use it
To use it, you can modify the prefix of the bot (line 22) or just use it as it is (lux). You can also use slash commands when implemented.
